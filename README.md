HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS!
The user can add tasks to the application if they have logged in successfully.
 The application displays the welcome message: “Welcome to Easy Kanban”. 
The user is then able to choose one of the following features from a numeric menu: a. Option 1) Add tasks b. Option 2) Show report - this feature is still in development and should display the following message: “Coming Soon”. c. Option 3) Quit 4.
 The application runs until the users selects quit to exit. Users can define how many tasks they wish to enter when the application starts, the application allows the user to enter only the set number of tasks.
